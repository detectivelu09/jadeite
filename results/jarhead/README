JARHEAD
-------


"New" to run Jarhead and log:
execRun.sh <location of jar folder>

After running this command, yo will have two .csv files:
"bin_attr.csv" which contains the binary attributes for the provided jar folder.

"results.csv" this file contains the results of the malware detection for the provided folder:0 bengin, and 1 malicious

Install:

Run make in src/java/

Usage:

python run.py <.jar or .class file to be checked>

OR

./run.sh <.jar or .class file to be checked> (Better Performance)

Note: The .jar or .class file needs to be in this directory (same as this README file)

Another note: The JohannesAppletPlugin is currently broken, will fix when jarhead is stable. Use run.py instead.

Yet another note: The current jarhead.model file has been somewhat tested and is fairly accurate.
