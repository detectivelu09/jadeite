The files in this folder are generated by running the "execRun.sh"

The "bin_attr... .csv" files contain the binary attributes extracted from jarhead for the examinded folder. These folders (in our case) are: the "test" and "train" datasets (each folder has two sub-folders the "ben" which stands for benign and "mal", which stands for malicious)

The "binary_attr_jarhead.csv" contains the binary attributes of all the previous files aggregated in one file (this file is used an input to the ML model, where it takes Jadeite's images and this file).

"results_... .csv" files contain the results of running Jarhead on the "test" and "train" dataset (each has two sub-folders: "ben", which is benign and "mal", which is malicious)

The "Jarhead_Accuracy.ipynb" is a jupyter notebook file that takes "results_test_ben.csv" and "results_test_mal.csv" files and computes the results (accuracy, f-score ...) for the Jarhead approach (on our testing data only).
